tel. (+48) 42-631-25-45
Zakład Techniki Sterowania jest jednym z czterech zakładów Instytutu Automatyki Politechniki Łódzkiej. W swojej pracy dydaktycznej i badawczej zespół pracowników zakładu od
wielu lat zajmuje się analogowymi i cyfrowymi elementami i układami
sterowania.
Główne kierunki badań Zakładu Techniki Sterowania związane są z następującą tematyką:
"projektowanie systemów mikroprocesorowych i układów elektronicznych dla zastosowań przemysłowych,"
"wspomagane komputerowo modelowanie procesów przemysłowych,"
rozwijanie algorytmów sterowania dla układów
"działających w oparciu o sterowniki programowalne PLC,"
"projektowanie układów automatyki z wykorzystaniem pakietów programowych: Matlab - Simulink, PSIM, Pspice - Or CAD, Scilab, Auto CAD,"
"projektowanie i programowanie systemów wbudowanych opartych na rdzeniach jednostek STM, TMS, ARM, PIC i innych."
"W ostatnich latach tematyka naukowo-badawcza Zakładu Techniki Sterowania koncentruje się wokół zagadnień, związanych z zastosowaniem teorii sterowania w napędach elektrycznych ze sterowaniem mikroprocesorowym"
przy wykorzystaniu mikroprocesorów sygnałowych oraz w układach automatyki
przemysłowej z wykorzystaniem sterowników programowalnych.
Zakład Techniki Sterowania może pochwalić się kilkoma ciekawymi rozwiązaniami autorskimi
wykonanymi przy współpracy z przemysłem. Należą do nich:
"mikroprocesorowe przekaźniki zabezpieczeniowo-sterownicze dla rozdzielni średnich napięć,"
"mikroprocesorowy miernik energii cieplnej,"
"algorytm i oprogramowanie sterujące hamowaniem docelowym pociągu Metropolis dla Metra Warszawskiego,"
metoda diagnostyki sygnałów wejściowych systemu wizualizacji i sterowania nadrzędnego
"układ wektorowego sterowania z procesorem sygnałowym dla trakcyjnych (tramwajowych i trolejbusowych) falownikowych napędów z silnikami indukcyjnymi,"
"układ regulacyjny w systemie ciepłowniczym w Łodzi, pozwalający na ciągłą współpracę elektrociepłowni EC-2 i EC-3 na wspólną"
magistralę ciepłowniczą.

O ROBOTERAPIIQUESTIONS / SPONSORS-->
"Projekt roboterapia powstał we współpracy trzech instytucji: Łódzkiego ASP, Politechniki Łódzkiej i fundacji Navicula."
"Jego celem jest skonstruowanie urządzeń i programów do wsparcia terapeutów dzieci głęboko upośledzonych, szczególnie z autyzmem."
W projekcie skupiamy się na pomocy terapeucie czy rodzicu nie tylko przy samej terapii ale także w odciążeniu go i uczynieniu jego pracy przyjemniejszą. Opieka nad dziećmi głęboko upośledzonymi wiąże się bowiem z dużym ryzykiem wypalenia.
"Na stronie można zapoznać się z opisem projektu jak i jego poszczególnych części, umieściliśmy także listę wszystkich publikacji związanych z projektem."

Zakład Napędu Elektrycznego i Automatyki Przemysłowej jest jednym z czterech zakładów Instytutu Automatyki Politechniki Łódzkiej. W swojej pracy dydaktycznej i badawczej zespół pracowników Zakładu od wielu lat zajmuje się tematyką związaną ze sterowaniem napędów i procesów przemysłowych.
Obecnie w Zakładzie realizowane są następujące tematy badawcze:
"sterowanie o zmiennej strukturze z ruchem ślizgowym,"
"zastosowanie logiki rozmytej i sieci neuronowych do sterowania układami napędowymi,"
"napędy wielosilnikowe prądu przemiennego,"
"sterowanie ruchem w sieciach teleinformatycznych,"
"sterowanie falowników poprzez sieci komputerowe,"
zastosowanie sterowników mikroprogramowalnych (PLC) do sterowania procesami przemysłowymi i napędami.
"Zakład realizował kilkanaście projektów badawczych NCN, FNP, KBN i M Ni SW. Wyniki niektórych badań zostały wdrożone w przemyśle. Obecnie trwają prace nad kolejnymi projektami."

Original Syntax
content:items
content:items is a sub-element of an RSS item or channel. It is used as follows:
&lt;content:items>
&lt;rdf:Bag>
&lt;rdf:li>
&lt;content:item>
&lt;!-- Use content:item as described below -->
&lt;/content:item>
&lt;/rdf:li>
"&lt;!-- Optionally, include as many more content:item elements as needed. -->"
&lt;/rdf:Bag>
&lt;/content:items>
content:item
"A content:item describes a single version of the content for its parent item. If the content is available on the Web at a specific address, content:item has an rdf:about attribute containg the URI of the content."
&lt;!-- Without a URI: -->
&lt;content:item>
&lt;!-- information about the item goes here -->
&lt;/content:item>
&lt;!-- With a URI: -->
"&lt;content:item rdf:about=""http://example.org/item/content.png"">"
&lt;!-- information about the item goes here -->
&lt;/content:item>
A content:item can include the following sub-elements:
content:format
Required. An empty element with an rdf:resource attribute that points to a URI representing the format of the content:item. Suggested best practice is to use the list of RDDL natures.
"&lt;content:format rdf:resource=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict"" />"
rdf:value
"Required if no URI is defined for the content:item. Includes the content of the content:item. This is encoded as specified by content:encoding. If the content is included as unencoded XML, then the attribute rdf:parse Type=""Literal"" should be used as to not confuse RDF parsers."
content:encoding
Optional. An empty element with an rdf:resource attribute that points to a URI representing the encoding of the content:item. An encoding is a reversable method of including content within the RSS file.
"If no encoding is specified, it should be assumed that the content is included as character data, like so:"
&lt;rdf:value&gt;This is &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;very&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; cool.&lt;/rdf:value&gt;
or
&lt;rdf:value&gt;&lt;![CDATA[This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cool.]]!>&lt;/rdf:value&gt;
"If the document is encoded as well-formed XML, the URI http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-wellformed should be used. An example of well-formed XML is:"
&lt;rdf:value&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; cool.&lt;/rdf:value&gt;
An example of a content:encoding exlement is:
"&lt;content:encoding rdf:resource=""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-wellformed"" />"
Example
"&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;"
&lt;rdf:RDF

Sumo Challenge 2020
Konkurencje
Sumo
"To najbardziej znana i&nbsp;charakterystyczna konkurencja turniejów robotycznych. Zadaniem sumo robotów, tak&nbsp;samo&nbsp;jak prawdziwych zawodników sumo, jest wypchnięcie przeciwnika poza ring. Zmagania odbywają się w&nbsp;kilku klasach różniących się rozmiarami i&nbsp;wagą - od&nbsp;dużych, silnych robotów w&nbsp;klasie Mega, po&nbsp;maleńkie roboty Nano, nieprzekraczające rozmiarami pudełka od&nbsp;zapałek!"
Regulamin
Line Follower
"W skrócie można powiedzieć, że jest to Formuła 1 w świecie robotów: wygrywa ten, który najszybciej pokona wyznaczoną trasę. W klasie Turbo roboty wykorzystują napędy tunelowe umożliwiające osiąganie większych prędkości, a w wersji Enhanced na trasie występują przeszkody i utrudnienia, które roboty muszą odpowiednio pokonać."
Regulamin
Micro Mouse
"Celem robota (tzw. myszy) w&nbsp;tej&nbsp;kategorii jest znalezienie możliwie najszybszej lub&nbsp;najkrótszej drogi w&nbsp;labiryncie. Zadanie to&nbsp;jest&nbsp;szczególnym wyzwaniem dla&nbsp;programistów, gdyż&nbsp;kluczowy jest&nbsp;dobry algorytm."
Regulamin
Humanoid Sprint
"To jedna z&nbsp;dwóch (obok Humanoid Sumo) kategorii dla&nbsp;robotów kroczących, których&nbsp;kształt i&nbsp;sposób poruszania przypomina ludzi. Z&nbsp;racji skomplikowanej konstrukcji mechanicznej zmagania te&nbsp;uchodzą za&nbsp;jedne z&nbsp;najtrudniejszych w&nbsp;świecie robotów."
Regulamin
Freestyle
"W&nbsp;tej&nbsp;kategorii obowiązuje pełna dowolność - brać w&nbsp;niej udział może każda konstrukcja, niezależnie od&nbsp;wymiarów ani&nbsp;zadań, które&nbsp;wykonuje. Roboty oceniane są&nbsp;przez&nbsp;jury i&nbsp;publiczność - celem jest wzbudzenie zainteresowania ciekawym pomysłem na&nbsp;robota."
Regulamin
Bear Rescue
Zadanie polega na&nbsp;zlokalizowaniu w&nbsp;prostym labiryncie małego misia-maskotki i&nbsp;przetransportowaniu go&nbsp;w&nbsp;bezpieczne miejsce.
Regulamin
Roborace
"Line follower jest dla&nbsp;Ciebie zbyt monotonny? A&nbsp;co&nbsp;jeśli zmierzysz się w&nbsp;prawdziwym wyścigu, w&nbsp;którym&nbsp;wszystkie chwyty są dozwolone, a&nbsp;na&nbsp;raz ściga się kilka robotów?"
Regulamin
Ketchup House
"""Keczup"" czy&nbsp;""Keczap""? Niezależnie którą&nbsp;wersję preferujesz, zapraszamy Cię do&nbsp;udziału w&nbsp;tej&nbsp;kategorii, gdzie&nbsp;dwa roboty szukają w&nbsp;prostym labiryncie puszek z&nbsp;ketchupem. Smacznego!"
Regulamin
Tom Tom Self-Driving Cars
"Autonomiczne samochody wyposażone w kamerę oraz sieć neuronową mają za zadanie w jak najkrótszym czasie wykonać pełne okrążenie toru. Istotna jest również precyzja, ponieważ tor nie posiada fizycznych ograniczeń uniemożliwiających samochodom wyjechanie poza jego obręb."
Regulamin

Vocabulary Encoding Scheme
Section 1: Introduction and Definitions
"This document is an up-to-date, authoritative specification of all metadata terms maintained by the Dublin Core™ Metadata Initiative. Included are the fifteen terms of the Dublin Core™ Metadata Element Set (also known as &quot;the Dublin Core&quot;) plus several dozen properties, classes, datatypes, and vocabulary encoding schemes. The &quot;Dublin Core&quot; plus these extension vocabularies are collectively referred to as &quot;DCMI metadata terms&quot; (&quot;Dublin Core terms&quot; for short). These terms are intended to be used in combination with metadata terms from other, compatible vocabularies in the context of application profiles."
"DCMI metadata terms are expressed in RDF vocabularies for use in Linked Data. Creators of non-RDF metadata can use the terms in contexts such as XML, JSON, UML, or relational databases by disregarding both the global identifier and the formal implications of the RDF-specific aspects of term definitions. Such users can take domain, range, subproperty, and subclass relations as usage suggestions and focus on the natural-language text of definitions, usage notes, and examples."
"Each term is identified with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), a global identifier usable in Linked Data. Term UR Is resolve to the (DCMI Metadata Terms) document when selected in a browser or, when referenced programmatically by RDF applications, to one of four RDF schemas. The scope of each RDF schema corresponds to a &quot;DCMI namespace&quot;, or set of DCMI metadata terms that are identified using a common base URI, as enumerated in the DCMI Namespace Policy. In Linked Data, the UR Is for DCMI namespaces are often declared as prefixes in order to make data, queries, and schemas more concise and readable."
The four DCMI namespaces are:
"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ The /elements/1.1/ namespace was created in 2000 for the RDF representation of the fifteen-element Dublin Core and has been widely used in data for more than twenty years. This namespace corresponds to the original scope of ISO 15836, which was published first in 2003 and last revised in 2017 as ISO 15836-1:2017 [ISO 15836-1:2017."
"http://purl.org/dc/terms/ The /terms/ namespace was originally created in 2001 for identifying new terms coined outside of the original fifteen-element Dublin Core. In 2008, in the context of defining formal semantic constraints for DCMI metadata terms in support of RDF applications, the original fifteen elements themselves were mirrored in the /terms/ namespace. As a result, there exists both a dc:date (http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date) with no formal range and a corresponding dcterms:date (http://purl.org/dc/terms/date) with a formal range of &quot;literal&quot;. While these distinctions are significant for creators of RDF applications, most users can safely treat the fifteen parallel properties as equivalent. The most useful properties and classes of DCMI Metadata Terms have now been published as ISO 15836-2:2019 [ISO 15836-2:2019]. While the /elements/1.1/ namespace will be supported indefinitely, DCMI gently encourages use of the /terms/ namespace."
"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/ The /dcmitype/ namespace was created in 2001 for the DCMI Type Vocabulary, which defines classes for basic types of thing that can be described using DCMI metadata terms."
http://purl.org/dc/dcam/ The /dcam/ namespace was created in 2008 for terms used in the description of DCMI metadata terms.
Each term is specified with the following minimal set of attributes:
Name:
A token appended to the URI of a DCMI namespace to create the URI of the term.
Label:
The human-readable label assigned to the term.
URI:
The Uniform Resource Identifier used to uniquely identify a term.
Definition:
A statement that represents the concept and essential nature of the term.
Type of Term:
"The type of term: property, class, datatype, or vocabulary encoding scheme."
"Where applicable, the following attributes provide additional information about a term:"
Comment:
Additional information about the term or its application.
See:
Authoritative documentation related to the term.
Subproperty Of:
A property of which the described term is a sub-property.
Superclass Of:
A class of which the described term is a super-class.

Abstract
"This specification describes the FOAF language, defined as a dictionary of named"
properties and classes using W3C's RDF technology.
Status of This Document
FOAF has been evolving gradually since its creation in mid-2000. There is now a stable core of classes and properties
"that will not be changed, beyond modest adjustments to their documentation to track"
implementation feedback and emerging best practices. New terms may be
"added at any time (as with a natural-language dictionary),"
and consequently this specification
"is an evolving work. The FOAF RDF namespace, by contrast, is fixed and it's"
"identifier is not expected to change. Furthermore, efforts are"
"underway to ensure the long-term preservation of the FOAF namespace, its xmlns.com"
domain name and associated documentation.
This document is created by combining the RDFS/OWL machine-readable
FOAF ontology with a set of per-term documents. Future versions may
incorporate multilingual translations of the
term definitions. The RDF version of the specification is also embedded in the HTML of this
"document, or available directly from the namespace URI by content negotiation."
"The FOAF specification is produced as part of the FOAF project, to provide"
"authoritative documentation of the contents, status and purpose"
of the RDF/XML vocabulary and document formats known informally
as 'FOAF'.
"The authors welcome comments on this document, preferably via the public FOAF developers list foaf-dev@lists.foaf-project.org;"
public archives are
"available. A historical backlog of known technical issues is acknowledged, and available for discussion in the"
"FOAF wiki. Proposals for resolving these issues are welcomed,"
either on foaf-dev or via the wiki. Further work is also needed on the explanatory text in this specification and on the
FOAF website; progress towards this will be measured in the version number of
future revisions to the FOAF specification.
This revision of the specification consists mostly of editorial improvments. In addition the
"properties maker and made, as well as the clases"
"Agent and Organization are now marked as ""stable"","
"in acknowledgement of their unproblematic usage in the Semantic Web community, and as an indicator that"
only minor changes to their document are anticipated for the future.
See the changes section
for details of the changes in this version of the specification.

Example
Here is a very basic document describing a person:
"&lt;foaf:Person rdf:about=""#me"" xmlns:foaf=""http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/""&gt;"
&lt;foaf:name&gt;Dan Brickley&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
&lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;241021fb0e6289f92815fc210f9e9137262c252e&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum&gt;
"&lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource=""http://danbri.org/"" /&gt;"
"&lt;foaf:img rdf:resource=""http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/mugshot/danbri-small.jpeg"" /&gt;"
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
This brief example introduces the basics of FOAF. It basically
"says, ""there is a foaf:Person with a"
foaf:name property of 'Dan Brickley' and
a foaf:mbox_sha1sum property of
241021fb0e6289f92815fc210f9e9137262c252e; this person stands in a
foaf:homepage relationship to a
thing called http://danbri.org/ and a foaf:img relationship to a thing called
http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/mugshot/danbri-small.jpeg.
1 Introduction: FOAF Basics
The Semantic Web
"To a computer, the Web is a flat, boring world, devoid of meaning."
"This is a pity, as in fact documents on the Web describe real objects and"
"imaginary concepts, and give particular relationships between them. For"
"example, a document might describe a person. The title document to a house describes a house and also the ownership relation"
with a person. Adding semantics to the Web involves two things: allowing documents which have information
"in machine-readable forms, and allowing links to be created with relationship"
values. Only
when we have this extra level of semantics will we be able to use computer power
to help us exploit the information to a greater extent than our own reading.
"- Tim Berners-Lee &quot;W3 future directions&quot; keynote, 1st World Wide Web Conference Geneva, May 1994"
FOAF and the Semantic Web
"FOAF, like the Web itself, is a linked information system. It is built using decentralised Semantic Web technology, and has been designed to allow for integration of data across"
"a variety of applications, Web sites and services, and software systems. To achieve this, FOAF takes a liberal approach to data"
"exchange. It does not require you to say anything at all about yourself or others, nor does it place any limits on the things you can"
"say or the variety of Semantic Web vocabularies you may use in doing so. This current specification provides a basic ""dictionary"" of"
terms for talking about people and the things they make and do.
"FOAF was designed to be used alongside other such dictionaries (""schemas"" or ""ontologies""), and to beusable with the wide variety"
"of generic tools and services that have been created for the Semantic Web. For example, the W3C work on SPARQL provides us with a rich query language for consulting databases of FOAF data,"
while the SKOS initiative explores in more detail than FOAF the problem of describing
"topics, categories, ""folksonomies"" and subject hierarchies. Meanwhile, other W3C groups are working on improved mechanisms for encoding"
all kinds of RDF data (including but not limited to FOAF) within Web pages: see the work of the GRDDL and RD Fa efforts for more
"detail. The Semantic Web provides us with an architecture for collaboration, allowing complex technical challenges to be"
shared by a loosely-coordinated community of developers.
The FOAF project is based around the use of machine
"readable Web homepages for people, groups, companies and"
"other kinds of thing. To achieve this we use the ""FOAF"
"vocabulary"" to provide a collection of basic terms that can be"
used in these Web pages. At the heart of the FOAF project is a
set of definitions designed to serve as a dictionary of terms
that can be used to express claims about the world. The initial
"focus of FOAF has been on the description of people, since people"
are the things that link together most of the other kinds of
"things we describe in the Web: they make documents, attend"
"meetings, are depicted in photos, and so on."
The FOAF Vocabulary definitions presented here are written
using a computer language (RDF/OWL) that makes it easy for
software to process some basic facts about the terms in the FOAF
"vocabulary, and consequently about the things described in FOAF"
"documents. A FOAF document, unlike a traditional Web page, can be"
combined with other FOAF documents to create a unified database
of information. FOAF is a Linked
"Data system, in that it based around the idea of linking together"
a Web of decentralised descriptions.
The Basic Idea
The basic idea is pretty simple. If people publish information
"in the FOAF document format, machines will be able to make use of"
"that information. If those files contain ""see also"" references to"
"other such documents in the Web, we will have a machine-friendly"
version of today's hypertext Web. Computer programs will be able
to scutter around a Web of documents designed for machines rather
"than humans, storing the information they find, keeping a list of"
"""see also"" pointers to other documents, checking digital"
signatures (for the security minded) and building Web pages and
question-answering services based on the harvested documents.
"So, what is the 'FOAF document format'? FOAF files are just"
"text documents (well, Unicode documents). They are written in XML"
"syntax, and adopt the conventions of the Resource Description"
"Framework (RDF). In addition, the FOAF vocabulary defines some"
"useful constructs that can appear in FOAF files, alongside other"
"RDF vocabularies defined elsewhere. For example, FOAF defines"
"categories ('classes') such as foaf:Person,"
"foaf:Document, foaf:Image, alongside"
"some handy properties of those things, such as"
"foaf:name, foaf:mbox (ie. an internet"
"mailbox), foaf:homepage etc., as well as some useful"
kinds of relationship that hold between members of these
"categories. For example, one interesting relationship type is"
foaf:depiction. This relates something (eg. a
foaf:Person) to a foaf:Image. The FOAF
demos that feature photos and listings of 'who is in which
picture' are based on software tools that parse RDF documents and
make use of these properties.
The specific contents of the FOAF vocabulary are detailed in
this FOAF namespace
"document. In addition to the FOAF vocabulary, one of the most"
"interesting features of a FOAF file is that it can contain ""see"
"Also"" pointers to other FOAF files. This provides a basis for"
automatic harvesting tools to traverse a Web of interlinked
"files, and learn about new people, documents, services,"
data...
The remainder of this specification describes how to publish
"and interpret descriptions such as these on the Web, using"
RDF/XML for syntax (file format) and terms from FOAF. It
introduces a number of categories (RDF classes such as 'Person')
and properties (relationship and attribute types such as 'mbox'
or 'workplace Homepage'). Each term definition is provided in both
"human and machine-readable form, hyperlinked for quick"
reference.
What's FOAF for?
"For a good general introduction to FOAF, see Edd Dumbill's"
"article, XML"
"Watch: Finding friends with XML and RDF (June 2002, IBM"
developer Works). Information about the use of FOAF with image metadata is
also available.
The co-depiction
experiment shows a fun use of the vocabulary. Jim Ley's SVG image
annotation tool show the use of FOAF with detailed image
"metadata, and provide tools for labelling image regions within a"
"Web browser. To create a FOAF document, you can use Leigh Dodd's"
FOAF-a-matic
"javascript tool. To query a FOAF dataset via IRC, you can use Edd"
Dumbill's FOA Fbot
"tool, an IRC 'community support agent'. For more information on"
"FOAF and related projects, see the FOAF project home page."
Background
FOAF is a collaborative effort amongst Semantic Web
developers on the FOAF (foaf-dev@lists.foaf-project.org) mailing
"list. The name 'FOAF' is derived from traditional internet usage,"
an acronym for 'Friend of a Friend'.
The name was chosen to reflect our concern with social
"networks and the Web, urban myths, trust and connections. Other"
"uses of the name continue, notably in the documentation and"
investigation of Urban Legends (eg. see the alt.folklore.urban archive or
"snopes.com), and other FOAF"
stories. Our use of the name 'FOAF' for a Web vocabulary and
"document format is intended to complement, rather than replace,"
these prior uses. FOAF documents describe the characteristics and
"relationships amongst friends of friends, and their friends, and"
the stories they tell.
FOAF and Standards
It is important to understand that the FOAF
vocabulary as specified in this document is not a
standard in the sense of ISO
"Standardisation, or that associated with W3C Process."
"FOAF depends heavily on W3C's standards work, specifically on"
"XML, XML Namespaces, RDF, and OWL. All FOAF documents"
"must be well-formed RDF/XML documents. The FOAF vocabulary, by"
"contrast, is managed more in the style of an Open Source or Free Software"
project than as an industry standardarisation effort (eg. see
Jabber
JE Ps).
"This specification contributes a vocabulary, ""FOAF"", to the"
"Semantic Web, specifying it using W3C's Resource Description Framework"
"(RDF). As such, FOAF adopts by reference both a syntax (using"
XML) a data model (RDF graphs) and a mathematically grounded
definition for the rules that underpin the FOAF design.
The FOAF Vocabulary Description
"This specification serves as the FOAF ""namespace document"". As"
such it describes the FOAF vocabulary and the terms (RDF classes and properties) that
"constitute it, so that Semantic Web applications can"
use those terms in a variety of RDF-compatible document formats
and applications.
This document presents FOAF as a Semantic Web vocabulary or
"Ontology. The FOAF vocabulary is pretty simple,"
pragmatic and designed to allow simultaneous deployment and
"extension. FOAF is intended for widescale use, but its authors"
make no commitments regarding its suitability for any particular
purpose.
Evolution and Extension of FOAF
The FOAF vocabulary is identified by the namespace URI
'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/'. Revisions and
"extensions of FOAF are conducted through edits to this document,"
which by convention is accessible in the Web via the namespace URI.
"For practical and deployment reasons, note that we do not"
update the namespace URI as the vocabulary matures.
"The core of FOAF now is considered stable, and the version number of"
"this specification reflects this stability. However, it"
long ago became impractical to update the namespace URI without
causing huge disruption to both producers and consumers of FOAF
"data. We are therefore left with the digits ""0.1"" in our URI. This"
stands as a warning to all those who might embed metadata in their
vocabulary identifiers.
The evolution of FOAF is best considered in terms of the
"stability of individual vocabulary terms, rather than the"
specification as a whole. As terms stabilise in usage and
"documentation, they progress through the categories"
"'unstable', 'testing' and"
'stable'.
The properties and types defined here provide some basic
useful concepts for use in FOAF descriptions. Other vocabulary
(eg. the Dublin Core
"metadata elements for simple bibliographic description), RSS 1.0"
"etc can also be mixed in with FOAF terms, as can local"
extensions. FOAF is designed to be extended. The Foaf Vocab page in the
FOAF wiki lists a number of extension vocabularies that are
particularly applicable to use with FOAF.
FOAF Auto-Discovery: Publishing and Linking FOAF files
If you publish a FOAF self-description (eg. using foaf-a-matic)
you can make it easier for tools to find your FOAF by putting
markup in the head of your HTML homepage. It doesn't
"really matter what filename you choose for your FOAF document,"
although foaf.rdf is a common choice. The linking
markup is as follows:
"&lt;link rel=""meta"""
"type=""application/rdf+xml"" title=""FOAF"""
"href=""http://example.com/people/~you/foaf.rdf"""
/&gt;
...although of course change the URL to point to your
own FOAF document. See also: more on FOAF
autodiscovery and services that make use of it.
FOAF and RDF
Why does FOAF use RDF?
FOAF is an application of the Resource Description Framework
(RDF) because the subject area we're describing -- people -- has
so many competing requirements that a standalone format could not
"do them all justice. By using RDF, FOAF gains a powerful"
"extensibility mechanism, allowing FOAF-based descriptions can be"
mixed with claims made in any other RDF vocabulary
People are the things that link together most of the other
"kinds of things we describe in the Web: they make documents,"
"attend meetings, are depicted in photos, and so on. Consequently,"
there are many many things that we might want to say about
"people, not to mention these related objects (ie. documents,"
"photos, meetings etc)."
FOAF as a vocabulary cannot incorporate everything we might
"want to talk about that is related to people, or it would be as"
large as a full dictionary. Instead of covering all topics within
"FOAF itself, we buy into a larger framework - RDF - that allows"
us to take advantage of work elsewhere on more specific
description vocabularies (eg. for geographical / mapping
data).
RDF provides FOAF with a way to mix together different
descriptive vocabularies in a consistent way. Vocabularies can be
created by different communites and groups as appropriate and
"mixed together as required, without needing any centralised"
agreement on how terms from different vocabularies can be written
down in XML.
"This mixing happens in two ways: firstly, RDF provides an"
underlying model of (typed) objects and their attributes or
relationships. foaf:Person is an example of a type
"of object (a ""class""), while foaf:knows and"
foaf:name are examples of a relationship and an
attribute of an foaf:Person; in RDF we call these
"""properties"". Any vocabulary described in RDF shares"
"this basic model, which is discernable in the syntax for RDF, and"
which removes one level of confusion in understanding a
"given vocabulary, making it simpler to comprehend and therefore"
reuse a vocabulary that you have not written yourself. This is
the minimal self-documentation that RDF gives you.
"Secondly, there are mechanisms for saying which RDF properties"
"are connected to which classes, and how different classes are"
"related to each other, using RDF Syntax and OWL. These can be"
quite general (all RDF properties by default come from an
rdf:Resource for example) or very specific and
"precise (for example by using OWL constructs, as in the"
foaf:Group example below. This is another form of
"self-documentation, which allows you to connect different"
vocabularies together as you please. An example of this is given
below where the foaf:based_near property has a
domain and range (types of class at each end of the property)
from a different namespace altogether.
"In summary then, RDF is self-documenting in ways which enable"
the creation and combination of vocabularies in a devolved
manner. This is particularly important for a vocabulary which
"describes people, since people connect to many other domains of"
"interest, which it would be impossible (as well as suboptimal)"
for a single group to describe adequately in non-geological
time.
"RDF is usually written using XML syntax, but behaves in rather"
different ways to 'vanilla' XML: the same RDF can be written in
many different ways in XML. This means that SAX and DOM XML
parsers are not adequate to deal with RDF/XML. If you want to
"process the data, you will need to use one of the many RDF"
"toolkits available, such as Jena (Java) or Redland (C). RDF"
Interest Group members can help with issues which may arise;
there is also the rdfweb-dev@yapours.rdfweb.org
"mailing list which is the main list for FOAF, and two active and"
friendly IRC channels:
#rdfig and #foaf on freenode.
FOAF cross-reference: Listing FOAF Classes and
Properties
FOAF introduces the following classes and properties. View
this document's source markup to see the RDF/XML version.
Classes and Properties (full detail)
Class: foaf:Agent
"Agent - An agent (eg. person, group, software or physical artifact)."
Status:
stable
in-range-of:foaf:maker foaf:member in-domain-of:foaf:mbox foaf:mbox_sha1sum foaf:gender foaf:jabber ID foaf:aim Chat ID foaf:icq Chat ID foaf:yahoo Chat ID foaf:msn Chat ID foaf:weblog foaf:tipjar foaf:made foaf:holds Account foaf:birthday
The foaf:Agent class is the class of agents; things that do stuff. A well
"known sub-class is foaf:Person, representing people. Other kinds of agents"
include foaf:Organization and foaf:Group.
The foaf:Agent class is useful in a few places in FOAF where
"foaf:Person would have been overly specific. For example, the IM chat ID"
"properties such as jabber ID are typically associated with people, but"
sometimes belong to software bots.
[back to top]
Class: foaf:Document
Document - A document.
Status:
testing
in-range-of:foaf:homepage foaf:weblog foaf:tipjar foaf:workplace Homepage foaf:work Info Homepage foaf:school Homepage foaf:interest foaf:publications foaf:is Primary Topic Of foaf:page foaf:account Service Homepage in-domain-of:foaf:sha1 foaf:topic foaf:primary Topic
"The foaf:Document class represents those things which are, broadly conceived,"
'documents'.
"The foaf:Image class is a sub-class of foaf:Document, since all images"
are documents.
"We do not (currently) distinguish precisely between physical and electronic documents, or"
between copies of a work and the abstraction those copies embody. The relationship between
documents and their byte-stream representation needs clarification (see foaf:sha1
for related issues).
[back to top]
Class: foaf:Group
Group - A class of Agents.
Status:
stable
in-domain-of:foaf:member
The foaf:Group class represents a collection of individual agents (and may
"itself play the role of a foaf:Agent, ie. something that can perform actions)."
"This concept is intentionally quite broad, covering informal and"
"ad-hoc groups, long-lived communities, organizational groups within a workplace, etc. Some"
such groups may have associated characteristics which could be captured in RDF (perhaps a
"foaf:homepage, foaf:name, mailing list etc.)."
"While a foaf:Group has the characteristics of a foaf:Agent, it"
is also associated with a number of other foaf:Agents (typically people) who
"constitute the foaf:Group. FOAF provides a mechanism, the"
"foaf:membership Class property, which relates a foaf:Group to a"
sub-class of the class foaf:Agent who are members of the group. This is a
"little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit."
The markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It
allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential
group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to
"describe individuals, the foaf:Group mechanism for categorising them into"
groups also becomes more powerful.
While the formal description of membership criteria for a foaf:Group may
"be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a foaf:Group is"
very simple. We simply use a foaf:member property of the
foaf:Group to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:
&lt;foaf:Group&gt;
&lt;foaf:name&gt;ILRT staff&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
&lt;foaf:member&gt;
&lt;foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;foaf:name&gt;Libby Miller&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
"&lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource=""http://ilrt.org/people/libby/""/&gt;"
"&lt;foaf:workplace Homepage rdf:resource=""http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/""/&gt;"
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;/foaf:member&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Group&gt;
"Behind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a"
member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.
Here is an example. We define a foaf:Group representing those people who
are ILRT staff members. The foaf:membership Class property connects the group (conceived of as a social
entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who
"constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the"
"ILRT Staff Person class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a"
foaf:Person and which have a foaf:workplace Homepage of
http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by
specifying a sub-class of foaf:Agent (in fact usually this
"will be a sub-class of foaf:Person), and giving criteria"
"for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the"
"owl:on Property and owl:has Value properties,"
indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching
agents.
&lt;!-- here we see a FOAF group described.
each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition
specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership --&gt;
&lt;foaf:Group&gt;
&lt;foaf:name&gt;ILRT staff&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
&lt;foaf:membership Class&gt;
"&lt;owl:Class rdf:about=""http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRT Staff Person""&gt;"
"&lt;rdfs:sub Class Of rdf:resource=""http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person""/&gt;"
&lt;rdfs:sub Class Of&gt;
&lt;owl:Restriction&gt;
"&lt;owl:on Property rdf:resource=""http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplace Homepage""/&gt;"
"&lt;owl:has Value rdf:resource=""http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/""/&gt;"
&lt;/owl:Restriction&gt;
&lt;/rdfs:sub Class Of&gt;
&lt;/owl:Class&gt;
&lt;/foaf:membership Class&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Group&gt;
Note that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRT Staff Person class are
based on a foaf:Person having a particular
"foaf:workplace Homepage, this places no obligations on the authors of actual"
"FOAF documents to include this information. If the information is included, then"
generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRT Staff Person. To go the extra
step and infer that some eg:ILRT Staff Person is a foaf:member of the group
"whose foaf:name is ""ILRT staff"", tools will need some knowledge of the way"
"FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way,"
but the full foaf:Group machinery requires extra work for implimentors.
"The current design names the relationship as pointing from the group,"
to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within
markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are
"allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to"
nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:
&lt;foaf:Group&gt;
"&lt;foaf:member rdf:node ID=""libby""/&gt;"
&lt;!-- more about the group here --&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Group&gt;
"&lt;foaf:Person rdf:node ID=""libby""&gt;"
&lt;!-- more about libby here --&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
There is a FOAF issue tracker
associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's OWL language for representing group-membership
"criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available"
"online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design"
"is solicited! Should we consider using SPARQL queries instead, for example?"

Class: foaf:Online Chat Account
Online Chat Account - An online chat account.
Status:

A foaf:Online Chat Account is a foaf:Online Account devoted to
chat / instant messaging.
"This is a generalization of the FOAF Chat ID properties,"
"foaf:jabber ID, foaf:aim Chat ID,"
"foaf:msn Chat ID, foaf:icq Chat ID and"
foaf:yahoo Chat ID.
"Unlike those simple properties, foaf:Online Account and associated FOAF terms"
"allows us to describe a great variety of online accounts, without having to anticipate"
them in the FOAF vocabulary.
"For example, here is a description of an IRC chat account, specific to the Freenode IRC"
network:
&lt;foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;foaf:name&gt;Dan Brickley&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
&lt;foaf:holds Account&gt;
&lt;foaf:Online Account&gt;

&lt;foaf:account Name&gt;danbri&lt;/foaf:account Name&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Online Account&gt;
&lt;/foaf:holds Account&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
Note that it may be impolite to carelessly reveal someone else's chat identifier (which
"might also serve as an indicate of email address) As with email,"
there are privacy and
anti-SPAM considerations. FOAF does not currently provide a way to
represent an
obfuscated chat ID (ie. there is no parallel to the foaf:mbox /
foaf:mbox_sha1sum mapping).
In addition to the generic foaf:Online Account and
"foaf:Online Chat Account mechanisms,"
FOAF also provides several convenience chat ID properties
"(foaf:jabber ID, foaf:aim Chat ID, foaf:icq Chat ID,"
"foaf:msn Chat ID,foaf:yahoo Chat ID)."
These serve as as a shorthand for some common cases; their use may not always be
appropriate.
We should specify some mappings between the abbreviated and full representations of
"Jabber, AIM, MSN, ICQ, Yahoo! and MSN chat"
accounts. This requires us to identify an appropriate foaf:account Service Homepage for each. If we
"wanted to make the foaf:Online Account mechanism even more generic, we could"
invent a relationship that holds between a foaf:Online Account instance and a
"convenience property. To continue the example above, we could describe how Freenode could define a property 'fn:freenode Chat ID'"
corresponding to Freenode online accounts.

Class: foaf:Personal Profile Document
Personal Profile Document - A personal profile RDF document.
Status:

The foaf:Personal Profile Document class represents those
"things that are a foaf:Document, and that use RDF to"
describe properties of the person who is the foaf:maker
of the document. There is just one foaf:Person described in
"the document, ie."
the person who foaf:made it and who will be its
foaf:primary Topic.
"The foaf:Personal Profile Document class, and FOAF's"
"associated conventions for describing it, captures an important"
deployment pattern for the FOAF vocabulary. FOAF is very often used in
public RDF documents made available through the Web. There is a
"colloquial notion that these ""FOAF files"" are often somebody's"
FOAF file. Through foaf:Personal Profile Document we provide
"a machine-readable expression of this concept, providing a basis for"
FOAF documents to make claims about their maker and topic.
When describing a foaf:Personal Profile Document it is
typical (and useful) to describe its associated foaf:Person
using the foaf:maker property. Anything that is a
foaf:Person and that is the foaf:maker of some
foaf:Document will be the foaf:primary Topic of
"that foaf:Document. Although this can be inferred, it is"
helpful to include this information explicitly within the
foaf:Personal Profile Document.
"For example, here is a fragment of a personal profile document which"
describes its author explicitly:
"&lt;foaf:Person rdf:node ID=""p1""&gt;"
&lt;foaf:name&gt;Dan Brickley&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
"&lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource=""http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/""/&gt;"

&lt;/foaf:Personal Profile Document&gt;
Note that a foaf:Personal Profile Document will have some
"representation as RDF. Typically this will be in W3C's RDF/XML syntax,"
"however we leave open the possibility for the use of other notations, or"
representational conventions including automated transformations from
HTML (GRDDL spec for
one such technique).

Range:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing
A foaf:current Project relates a foaf:Person
to a foaf:Document indicating some collaborative or
individual undertaking.
This relationship
indicates that the foaf:Person has some active role in the
"project, such as development, coordination, or support."
"When a foaf:Person is no longer involved with a project, or"
"perhaps is inactive for some time, the relationship becomes a"
foaf:past Project.
If the foaf:Person has stopped working on a project because it
"has been completed (successfully or otherwise), foaf:past Project is"
"applicable. In general, foaf:current Project is used to indicate"
"someone's current efforts (and implied interests, concerns etc.), while"
foaf:past Project describes what they've previously been doing.
"Generally speaking, anything that a foaf:Person has"
foaf:made could also qualify as a
foaf:current Project or foaf:past Project.

Note that this property requires further work. There has been confusion about
"whether it points to a thing (eg. something you've made; a homepage for a project,"
"ie. a foaf:Document or to instances of the class foaf:Project,"
"which might themselves have a foaf:homepage. In practice, it seems to have been"

Range:

The foaf:depiction property is a relationship between a thing and an
foaf:Image that depicts it. As such it is an inverse of the
foaf:depicts relationship.
A common use of foaf:depiction (and foaf:depicts) is to indicate
"the contents of a digital image, for example the people or objects represented in an"
online photo gallery.
Extensions to this basic idea include 'Co-Depiction' (social networks as evidenced in
"photos), as well as richer photo metadata through the mechanism"
of using SVG paths to
indicate the regions of an image which depict some particular thing. See 'Annotating Images With SVG'
for tools and details.
The basic notion of 'depiction' could also be extended to deal with multimedia content
"(video clips, audio), or refined to deal with corner cases, such as pictures of pictures etc."
The foaf:depiction property is a super-property of the more specific property
"foaf:img, which is used more sparingly. You stand in a"
foaf:depiction relation to any foaf:Image that depicts
"you, whereas foaf:img is typically used to indicate a few images that are"

See the Code of the Geeks specification for
"details of the code, which provides a somewhat frivolous and willfully obscure mechanism for"
"characterising technical expertise, interests and habits. The foaf:geekcode"
property is not bound to any particular version of the code. The last published version
of the code was v3.12 in March 1996.
"As the Geek Code website notes, the code played a small"
(but amusing) part in the history of the Internet. The foaf:geekcode property
exists in acknowledgement of this history. It'll never be 1996 again.
Note that the Geek Code is a densely packed collections of claims about the person it applies
to; to express these claims explicitly in RDF/XML would be incredibly verbose. The syntax of the
"Geek Code allows for '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters, which have special meaning in RDF/XML."
Consequently these should be carefully escaped in markup.
An example Geek Code:

Property: foaf:gender
gender - The gender of this Agent (typically but not necessarily 'male' or 'female').
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Agent
Range:
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal
The foaf:gender property relates a foaf:Agent (typically a
foaf:Person) to a string representing its gender. In most cases the value
will be the string 'female' or 'male' (in lowercase without surrounding quotes or spaces).
"Like all FOAF properties, there is in general no requirement to use"
foaf:gender in any particular document or description. Values other than
"'male' and 'female' may be used, but are not enumerated here. The foaf:gender"
"mechanism is not intended to capture the full variety of biological, social and sexual"
concepts associated with the word 'gender'.
Anything that has a foaf:gender property will be some kind of
foaf:Agent. However there are kinds of foaf:Agent to
which the concept of gender isn't applicable (eg. a foaf:Group). FOAF does not
"currently include a class corresponding directly to ""the type of thing that has a gender""."
"At any point in time, a foaf:Agent has at most one value for"
foaf:gender. FOAF does not treat foaf:gender as a
static property; the same individual may have different values for this property
at different times.
Note that FOAF's notion of gender isn't defined biologically or anatomically - this would
be tricky since we have a broad notion that applies to all foaf:Agents
"(including robots - eg. Bender from Futurama is 'male'). As stressed above,"
FOAF's notion of gender doesn't attempt to encompass the full range of concepts associated
"with human gender, biology and sexuality. As such it is a (perhaps awkward) compromise"
"between the clinical and the social/psychological. In general, a person will be the best"
authority on their foaf:gender. Feedback on this design is
"particularly welcome (via the FOAF mailing list,"
rdfweb-dev). We have tried to
be respectful of diversity without attempting to catalogue or enumerate that diversity.
"This may also be a good point for a periodic reminder: as with all FOAF properties,"
"documents that use 'foaf:gender' will on occassion be innacurate, misleading"
"or outright false. FOAF, like all open means of communication, supports lying."
Application authors using
"FOAF data should always be cautious in their presentation of unverified information, but be"
particularly sensitive to issues and risks surrounding sex and gender (including privacy
and personal safety concerns). Designers of FOAF-based user interfaces should be careful to allow users to omit
"foaf:gender when describing themselves and others, and to allow at least for"
values other than 'male' and 'female' as options. Users of information
"conveyed via FOAF (as via information conveyed through mobile phone text messages, email,"
"Internet chat, HTML pages etc.) should be skeptical of unverified information."

Status:

Domain:
foaf:Person
Range:
foaf:Image
The foaf:img property relates a foaf:Person to a
foaf:Image that represents them. Unlike its super-property
"foaf:depiction, we only use foaf:img when an image is"
particularly representative of some person. The analogy is with the image(s) that might
"appear on someone's homepage, rather than happen to appear somewhere in their photo album."
"Unlike the more general foaf:depiction property (and its inverse,"
"foaf:depicts), the foaf:img property is only used with"
representations of people (ie. instances of foaf:Person). So you can't use
"it to find pictures of cats, dogs etc. The basic idea is to have a term whose use is more"
restricted than foaf:depiction so we can have a useful way of picking out a
reasonable image to represent someone. FOAF defines foaf:img as a
"sub-property of foaf:depiction, which means that the latter relationship is"
implied whenever two things are related by the former.
"Note that foaf:img does not have any restrictions on the dimensions, colour"
"depth, format etc of the foaf:Image it references."
"Terminology: note that foaf:img is a property (ie. relationship), and that"
"code:Image is a similarly named class (ie. category, a type of thing). It"
might have been more helpful to call foaf:img 'mugshot' or similar; instead
it is named by analogy to the HTML IMG element.

Property: foaf:interest
interest - A page about a topic of interest to this person.
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Person
Range:
foaf:Document
The foaf:interest property represents an interest of a
"foaf:Agent, through"
indicating a foaf:Document whose foaf:topic(s) broadly
characterises that interest.
"For example, we might claim that a person or group has an interest in RDF by saying they"
"stand in a foaf:interest relationship to the RDF home page. Loosly, such RDF would be saying"
"""this agent is interested in the topic of this page""."
Uses of foaf:interest include a variety of filtering and resource discovery
"applications. It could be used, for example, to help find answers to questions such as"
"""Find me members of this organisation with an interest in XML who have also contributed to"
"CPAN)""."
This approach to characterising interests is intended to compliment other mechanisms (such
as the use of controlled vocabulary). It allows us to use a widely known set of unique
identifiers (Web page UR Is) with minimal pre-coordination. Since UR Is have a controlled
"syntax, this makes data merging much easier than the use of free-text characterisations of"
interest.
"Note that interest does not imply expertise, and that this FOAF term provides no support"
for characterising levels of interest: passing fads and lifelong quests are both examples
of someone's foaf:interest. Describing interests in full is a complex
undertaking; foaf:interest provides one basic component of FOAF's approach to
these problems.

foaf:page is a super-property of foaf:is Primary Topic Of. The change

Property: foaf:knows
knows - A person known by this person (indicating some level of reciprocated interaction between the parties).
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Person
Range:
foaf:Person
The foaf:knows property relates a foaf:Person to another
foaf:Person that he or she knows.
"We take a broad view of 'knows', but do require some form of reciprocated interaction (ie."
stalkers need not apply). Since social attitudes and conventions on this topic vary
"greatly between communities, counties and cultures, it is not appropriate for FOAF to be"
overly-specific here.
"If someone foaf:knows a person, it would be usual for"
the relation to be reciprocated. However this doesn't mean that there is any obligation
for either party to publish FOAF describing this relationship. A foaf:knows
"relationship does not imply friendship, endorsement, or that a face-to-face meeting"
"has taken place: phone, fax, email, and smoke signals are all perfectly"
acceptable ways of communicating with people you know.
"You probably know hundreds of people, yet might only list a few in your public FOAF file."
That's OK. Or you might list them all. It is perfectly fine to have a FOAF file and not
list anyone else in it at all.
This illustrates the Semantic Web principle of partial description: RDF documents
"rarely describe the entire picture. There is always more to be said, more information"
living elsewhere in the Web (or in our heads...).
"Since foaf:knows is vague by design, it may be suprising that it has uses."
"Typically these involve combining other RDF properties. For example, an application might"
look at properties of each foaf:weblog that was foaf:made by
"someone you ""foaf:knows"". Or check the newsfeed of the online photo archive"
"for each of these people, to show you recent photos taken by people you know."
"To provide additional levels of representation beyond mere 'knows', FOAF applications"
can do several things.
They can use more precise relationships than foaf:knows to relate people to
"people. The original FOAF design included two of these ('knows Well','friend') which we"
"removed because they were somewhat awkward to actually use, bringing an"
inappopriate air of precision to an intrinsically vague concept. Other extensions have
"been proposed, including Eric Vitiello's Relationship module for"
FOAF.
In addition to using more specialised inter-personal relationship types
(eg rel:acquaintance Of etc) it is often just as good to use RDF descriptions of the states
"of affairs which imply particular kinds of relationship. So for example, two people who"
have the same value for their foaf:workplace Homepage property are
"typically colleagues. We don't (currently) clutter FOAF up with these extra relationships,"
"but the facts can be written in FOAF nevertheless. Similarly, if there exists a"
"foaf:Document that has two people listed as its foaf:makers,"
then they are probably collaborators of some kind. Or if two people appear in 100s of
"digital photos together, there's a good chance they're friends and/or colleagues."
So FOAF is quite pluralistic in its approach to representing relationships between people.
FOAF is built on top of a general purpose machine language for representing relationships
"(ie. RDF), so is quite capable of representing any kinds of relationship we care to add."
The problems are generally social rather than technical; deciding on appropriate ways of
describing these interconnections is a subtle art.
"Perhaps the most important use of foaf:knows is, alongside the"
"rdfs:see Also property, to connect FOAF files together. Taken alone, a FOAF"
file is somewhat dull. But linked in with 1000s of other FOAF files it becomes more
"interesting, with each FOAF file saying a little more about people, places, documents, things..."
"By mentioning other people (via foaf:knows or other relationships), and by"
"providing an rdfs:see Also link to their FOAF file, you can make it easy for"
FOAF indexing tools ('scutters') to find
your FOAF and the FOAF of the people you've mentioned. And the FOAF of the people they
"mention, and so on. This makes it possible to build FOAF aggregators without the need for"
a centrally managed directory of FOAF files...

OWL Type:
An Inverse Functional Property (uniquely identifying property)
Domain:
foaf:Agent
Range:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing
The foaf:mbox property is a relationship between the owner of a mailbox and
a mailbox. These are typically identified using the mailto: URI scheme (see RFC 2368).
Note that there are many mailboxes (eg. shared ones) which are not the
"foaf:mbox of anyone. Furthermore, a person can have multiple"
foaf:mbox properties.
"In FOAF, we often see foaf:mbox used as an indirect way of identifying its"
"owner. This works even if the mailbox is itself out of service (eg. 10 years old), since"
"the property is defined in terms of its primary owner, and doesn't require the mailbox to"
actually be being used for anything.
Many people are wary of sharing information about their mailbox addresses in public. To
address such concerns whilst continuing the FOAF convention of indirectly identifying
"people by referring to widely known properties, FOAF also provides the"
"foaf:mbox_sha1sum mechanism, which is a relationship between a person and"
the value you get from passing a mailbox URI to the SHA1 mathematical function.

A foaf:mbox_sha1sum of a foaf:Person is a textual representation of

Internet mailbox that they stand in a foaf:mbox relationship to.
"In other words, if you have a mailbox (foaf:mbox) but don't want to reveal its"
"address, you can take that address and generate a foaf:mbox_sha1sum representation"
"of it. Just as a foaf:mbox can be used as an indirect identifier for its owner, we"
can do the same with foaf:mbox_sha1sum since there is only one
foaf:Person with any particular value for that property.
Many FOAF tools use foaf:mbox_sha1sum in preference to exposing mailbox
information. This is usually for privacy and SPAM-avoidance reasons. Other relevant techniques
include the use of PGP encryption (see Edd Dumbill's
documentation) and the use of FOAF-based whitelists for
mail filtering.

The foaf:myers Briggs property represents the Myers Briggs (MBTI) approach to

"that takes certain constrained values, and to give some additional detail to the FOAF"
files of those who choose to include it. The foaf:myers Briggs property applies only to the
"foaf:Person class; wherever you see it, you can infer it is being applied to"
a person.
The foaf:myers Briggs property is interesting in that it illustrates how
"FOAF can serve as a carrier for various kinds of information, without necessarily being"
"commited to any associated worldview. Not everyone will find myers Briggs (or star signs,"
"or blood types, or the four humours) a useful perspective on human behaviour and"
personality. The inclusion of a Myers Briggs property doesn't indicate that FOAF endorses
"the underlying theory, any more than the existence of foaf:weblog is an"
endorsement of soapboxes.
The values for foaf:myers Briggs are the following 16 4-letter textual codes:
"ESTJ, INFP, ESFP, INTJ, ESFJ, INTP, ENFP, ISTJ, ESTP, INFJ, ENFJ, ISTP, ENTJ, ISFP,"
"ENTP, ISFJ. If multiple of these properties are applicable, they are represented by"
applying multiple properties to a person.
"For further reading on MBTI, see various online sources (eg. this article). There"
are various online sites which offer quiz-based tools for determining a person's MBTI
classification. The owners of the MBTI trademark have probably not approved of these.
"This FOAF property suggests some interesting uses, some of which could perhaps be used to"
test the claims made by proponents of the MBTI (eg. an analysis of weblog postings
filtered by MBTI type). However it should be noted that MBTI FOAF descriptions are
self-selecting; MBTI categories may not be uniformly appealing to the people they
"describe. Further, there is probably a degree of cultural specificity implicit in the"
assumptions made by many questionaire-based MBTI tools; the MBTI system may not make
sense in cultural settings beyond those it was created for.

"tracker for design discussions, status and ongoing work on rationalising the FOAF"
naming machinery.
There is also a simple foaf:name property.

Property: foaf:theme
theme - A theme.
Status:
unstable
Domain:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing
Range:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing
The foaf:theme property is rarely used and under-specified. The intention was
to use it to characterise interest / themes associated with projects and groups. Further
work is needed to meet these goals.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:thumbnail
thumbnail - A derived thumbnail image.
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Image
Range:
foaf:Image
The foaf:thumbnail property is a relationship between a
"full-size foaf:Image and a smaller, representative foaf:Image"
that has been derrived from it.
It is typical in FOAF to express foaf:img and foaf:depiction
"relationships in terms of the larger, 'main' (in some sense) image, rather than its thumbnail(s)."
A foaf:thumbnail might be clipped or otherwise reduced such that it does not
depict everything that the full image depicts. Therefore FOAF does not specify that a
thumbnail foaf:depicts everything that the image it is derrived from depicts.
"However, FOAF does expect that anything depicted in the thumbnail will also be depicted in"
the source image.
A foaf:thumbnail is typically small enough that it can be
loaded and viewed quickly before a viewer decides to download the larger
version. They are often used in online photo gallery applications.

Property: foaf:tipjar
"tipjar - A tipjar document for this agent, describing means for payment and reward."
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Agent
Range:
foaf:Document
The foaf:tipjar property relates an foaf:Agent
to a foaf:Document that describes some mechanisms for
paying or otherwise rewarding that agent.
The foaf:tipjar property was created following discussions
"about simple, lightweight mechanisms that could be used to encourage"
rewards and payment for content exchanged online. An agent's
"foaf:tipjar page(s) could describe informal (""Send me a"
"postcard!"", ""here's my book, music and movie wishlist"") or formal"
(machine-readable micropayment information) information about how that
agent can be paid or rewarded. The reward is not associated with any
particular action or content from the agent concerned. A link to
a service such as Pay Pal is the
sort of thing we might expect to find in a tipjar document.
Note that the value of a foaf:tipjar property is just a
"document (which can include anchors into HTML pages). We expect, but"
"do not currently specify, that this will evolve into a hook"
"for finding more machine-readable information to support payments,"
"rewards. The foaf:Online Account machinery is also relevant,"
although the information requirements for automating payments are not
currently clear.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:title
"title - Title (Mr, Mrs, Ms, Dr. etc)"
Status:
testing
"The approriate values for foaf:title are not formally constrained, and will"
"vary across community and context. Values such as 'Mr', 'Mrs', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc. are"
expected.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:topic
topic - A topic of some page or document.
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Document
Range:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing
The foaf:topic property relates a document to a thing that the document is
about.
"As such it is an inverse of the foaf:page property, which relates a thing to"
a document about that thing.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:topic_interest
interest_topic - A thing of interest to this person.
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Person
Range:
http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing
The foaf:topic_interest property is generally found to be confusing and ill-defined
and is a candidate for removal. The goal was to be link a person to some thing that is a topic
"of their interests (rather than, per foaf:interest to a page that is about such a"
topic).
[back to top]
Property: foaf:weblog
"weblog - A weblog of some thing (whether person, group, company etc.)."
Status:
testing
OWL Type:
An Inverse Functional Property (uniquely identifying property)
Domain:
foaf:Agent
Range:
foaf:Document
The foaf:weblog property relates a foaf:Agent to a weblog of
that agent.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:work Info Homepage
work info homepage - A work info homepage of some person; a page about their work for some organization.
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Person
Range:
foaf:Document
The foaf:work Info Homepage of a foaf:Person is a
foaf:Document that describes their work. It is generally (but not necessarily) a
"different document from their foaf:homepage, and from any"
foaf:workplace Homepage(s) they may have.
"The purpose of this property is to distinguish those pages you often see, which describe"
"someone's professional role within an organisation or project. These aren't really homepages,"
although they share some characterstics.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:workplace Homepage
workplace homepage - A workplace homepage of some person; the homepage of an organization they work for.
Status:
testing
Domain:
foaf:Person
Range:
foaf:Document
The foaf:workplace Homepage of a foaf:Person is a
foaf:Document that is the foaf:homepage of a
foaf:Organization that they work for.
"By directly relating people to the homepages of their workplace, we have a simple convention"
"that takes advantage of a set of widely known identifiers, while taking care not to confuse the"
things those identifiers identify (ie. organizational homepages) with the actual organizations
those homepages describe.
"For example, Dan Brickley works at W3C. Dan is a foaf:Person with a"
foaf:homepage of http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/; W3C is a
foaf:Organization with a foaf:homepage of http://www.w3.org/. This
allows us to say that Dan has a foaf:workplace Homepage of http://www.w3.org/.
&lt;foaf:Person&gt;
&lt;foaf:name>Dan Brickley&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
"&lt;foaf:workplace Homepage rdf:resource=""http://www.w3.org/""/&gt;"
&lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
Note that several other FOAF properties work this way;
"foaf:school Homepage is the most similar. In general, FOAF often indirectly"
"identifies things via Web page identifiers where possible, since these identifiers are widely"
used and known. FOAF does not currently have a term for the name of the relation (eg.
"""workplace"") that holds"
between a foaf:Person and an foaf:Organization that they work for.
[back to top]
Property: foaf:yahoo Chat ID
Yahoo chat ID - A Yahoo chat ID
Status:
testing
OWL Type:
An Inverse Functional Property (uniquely identifying property)
Domain:
foaf:Agent
Range:
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal
The foaf:yahoo Chat ID property relates a foaf:Agent to a textual
identifier assigned to them in the Yahoo online Chat system.
See Yahoo's the Yahoo! Chat site for more details of their
"service. Yahoo chat I Ds are also used across several other Yahoo services, including email and"
Yahoo! Groups.
See foaf:Online Chat Account (and foaf:Online Account) for a
more general (and verbose) mechanism for describing IM and chat accounts.

Acknowledgments
There are far too many people who have contributed to the FOAF
project to name everyone in this early-release of the new
improved spec. FOAF wouldn't be such a fun project or be as
"widely known as it is today without the efforts, enthusiasm and"
"intelligence of the folks who have contributed via the rdfweb-dev list,"
"#foaf IRC channel, and"
Foaf Project
wiki site.
"That said, a few milestones in FOAF's recent history should be"
mentioned... We owe particular thanks to Edd Dumbill for his IBM
developer Works articles (which attracted the affections of the
Weblogging crowd) and for his Foafbot application whose evolution
"those articles have tracked. Also Morten Frederiksen's Foaf Explorer,"
Daniel Krech's Web View
"aggregator, Jim Ley and Liz Turner's work on FOAF Naut, which alongside FOA Fbot,"
&circ;have been instrumental in showing how FOAF data can be
collected and used. Meanwhile Leigh Dodd's foaf-a-matic
has been the data creation tool that has been most people's
"gateway to FOA Fdom. FOAF also owes a lot to the folks at Ecademy, Type Pad and elsewhere for showing"
how end users can share FOAF self-descriptions on the Web without
ever seeing a line of XML syntax. Jo Walsh has
enthused many
"about hooking FOAF up to Geo and mapping data, as has Matt"
Biddulph by explaining the
workings of his FOAF harvesting and image metadata tools. FOAF
has also benefited greatly from documentation contributed in
"non-English languages, many thanks to all contributors of"
translations (foaf-a-matic and other docs). FOAF is now arguably
better documented in Japanese and
Spanish
"than in English, thanks to Masahide Kanzaki and Leandro Mariano"
Lopez (inkel) respectively. Thanks also to Chris Schmidt for fixing up
the spec generation tool (now a
"Python/Redland script), as well as for contributing numerous"
cool hacks to the FOAF
"community. And last but not least, Marc Canter is in a class of his own."
This brief survey only scratches the surface of a growing body
"of work. Sincere thanks to all who have contributed tools,"
"documentation, brain cells and enthusiasm to this project. We"
should also mention that FOAF would not be possible without the
collaborative and opensource efforts of the RDF/XML developer
"community, both in terms of idea sharing (#swig etc) and freely"
"available tools (Jena, Redland, RD Flib, Cwm, Sesame, 3store"
etc).

"...different to the other IM I Ds, as Jabber has wider usage, so"

Recent Changes
2007-05-24
"terms: Organization, Group, member, made, maker are now stable."
editorial: Table of contents represents actual rather than desired structure. links fixed.
process: Clarified that the specification version and URL are not 0.1; publishing at /foaf/spec
editorial: Noted that the namespace URI will not change. Given the spec a version (0.9)
"editorial: CSS tweaks (grey boxes for terms), margins, justification"
editorial: Removed various TOD Os and editorial comments
editorial: Updated text for Organization to indicate relationship with Group
"web: Web server configuration now serves 303 redirects for terms, and RDF at the namespace URI if application/rdf+xml"
requested
"editorial: Updated mentions of rdfig to be swig, rdfweb-dev to be foaf-dev; fixed links accordingly"
"editorial: Removed link to validator, since we have RDF inside and the dtd-based"
validator doesn't like mixed-namespace documents.
web: created /foaf/spec for specification documents (and archive)
editorial: Re-organized boilerplate section slightly (spec has url for current version).
editorial: Updated per-term documentation to link to wiki issue tracker
instead of the old bugzilla installation.
editorial: Updated foaf:Group documentation to mention possiblility of SPARQL
editorial: Updated foaf:name documentation to mention possibility of XML Literal datatyped values
"editorial: Fixed or removed various bad links (ichat, python, internal links)"
"editorial: Reworded copyright statement to clarify intent; we used to say ""and does not apply to FOAF data formats, vocabulary"
"terms, or technology."", which gave impression we were holding stuff back. Rather, this is just our understanding of copyright. The"
underlying technology part is completely supplied by W3C's specifications.
"web: added ""rel='alternate'"" to document header to aid RDF discovery"
Previous Changes
